The article, **“Cloud Based Healthcare Application Architecture and Electronic Medical Record Mining: An Integrated Approach to Improve Healthcare System,”** discusses how modern information technology, specifically cloud computing, can significantly enhance healthcare systems. The authors note that in underdeveloped and developing countries, traditional paper-based systems are still prevalent in healthcare. Even where computer-based systems are in use, a ubiquitous network among patients, physicians, and government has not been established.

The authors propose the use of cloud computing to develop a heterogeneous network to improve the system. They present a three-tier cloud-based application called “eHealth Cloud” designed to involve different parties to enhance the traditional healthcare system. The application consists of a Rich Internet Application (RIA) based client, a SimpleDB based server, and a logic layer, all designed to build an easily accessible network.

The “eHealth Cloud” will store a vast amount of electronic medical records (EMR) every day. This large data set presents new research opportunities, particularly in the area of data mining. The authors propose a process for data mining from the large amount of EMR, including a standard for exchanging data and a mining model. They also discuss the challenges and future research options.

The article highlights how cloud computing is becoming an easy solution for delivering complex services and data interchange methods over the internet. It has already gained worldwide attention by providing services like Gmail, Google Docs, Dropbox, etc. The authors note that cloud computing is one of the fastest-growing internet technologies, developed as an extension of grid computing where resources and services overlay on the hardware infrastructure.
